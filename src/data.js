        description: "Around 100 years ago, in an article that appeared in the London Spectator, the poet Blanche Baughan declared the Milford Track to be ‘the finest walk in the world’.  The Milford Track will show you pristine lakes, sky-scraping mountain peaks and enormous valley views. It will take you to feel the misty breath of Sutherland Falls, the tallest waterfall in New Zealand. Arguably New Zealand’s most famous walk, the 53 kilometre journey begins at the head of Lake Te Anau, and leads you across suspension bridges, board walks and a mountain pass. The fitter you are the more you will enjoy yourself, so a good level of fitness and strength is necessary.",

The route provides the visitor with the opportunity “to get away from it all” without having to travel too far in this busy part of England. The undulating route provides a wonderful trip for long distance riders as well as walkers. It also provides interesting day trips and short breaks. ",

When the snow melted 5 years ago (due to climate change), it instantly became one of the most picturesque places to visit in Peru. Head out on this 6.9-km out-and-back trail near Pitumarca, Cusco. Generally considered a moderately challenging route, it takes an average of 2 h 30 min to complete. This is a very popular area for hiking and horseback riding, so you'll likely encounter other people while exploring.",
